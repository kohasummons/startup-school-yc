- If you want to be an employee, go FAANG. Founders, maybe not.
- Be super optimisic.
- Have a plan when you get in to FAANG

## Reality of the FAANG GIG
- Way more folks do shitty tasks at FAANG than those who do.

## Skills that can transfer to your startup?
- You don't get so many transferrable process for startups from FAANG.
- You got to unlearn a lot if you coming from FAANG.

## The FUNDING path
- Who writes about the Unsuccessful fundraisers? Dont' fall for that story about EX-FAANG dudes raising.

## The Retention Trap
- The Retention flow is gamified.
- The Vesting Trap. Dark patterns.
- Folks around you start upscaling their lifestyle. That's might not apply to you who is looking to start a startup. 

## When to get heck out
