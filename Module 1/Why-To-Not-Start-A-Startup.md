# Key points by Paul Graham
- The big mystery to me is: why don't more people start startups? If nearly everyone who does it prefers it to a regular job, and a significant percentage get rich, why doesn't everyone want to do this?
-There's nothing wrong with being unsure. If you're a hacker thinking about starting a startup and hesitating before taking the leap, you're part of a grand tradition.
-The way to deal with uncertainty is to analyze it into components. Most people who are reluctant to do something have about eight different reasons mixed together in their heads, and don't know themselves which are biggest.

## Reasons why you should not start a startup, then ignore it
- Too young.
- Too inexperienced
- Not determined enough
- Not smart enough
- Know nothing about business
- No cofounder
- No idea
- No room for more startups
- Family to suppor 
- Independently wealthy
- Not ready for commitment
- Need for structure
- Fear of uncertainty
- Don't realize what you're avoiding
- Parents want you to be a doctor
- A job is the default

## Recipe for getting startup ideas
- Find something that's missing in your own life, and supply that needâ€”no matter how specific to you it seems.
- A need that's narrow but genuine is a better starting point than one that's broad but hypothetical

## Notes that stood out
- Thought experiment: If doctors did the same work, but as impoverished outcasts, which parents would still want their kids to be doctors
