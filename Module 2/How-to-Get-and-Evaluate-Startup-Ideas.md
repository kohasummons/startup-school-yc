## Key points by Jared Friedman

- No one knows what ideas will succeed.
- Execution, major ingredient to the idea success
- There are good ideas to start with.

## Mistakes founders make with startup ideas
- Building something that solves nothing(a real problem). 
- A solution in search of a problem (SISP)
    - instead: Fall in love with the problem
    - Start with a high quality idea
- Getting stuck with a tarpit idea
    - Problem that no one as solved
    - Tarpit ideas are not neccessarily impossible
    - Just common ideas that are harder than the seem
- Not evaluating an idea
- Waiting for the perfect idea
    - Instead: PG says "You should think of your initial idea as a good starting point. Startup ideas morph over time."

## How to know if an idea is Good
- Framework: 10 key questions to ask about any startup ideas
    - Do you have founder/market fit? 
        - are you the right team to be working on this idea?
        - Think of the starting point as a good idea for your team?
    - Is there a big market or a small but rapidly growing market?
    - How acute is this problem?
    - Do you have competition?
        - Competition is not bad. 
        - Going against entrenched competition needs you to find a new angle
    - Do you want this?
    - Did this become recently possible or neccessary?
    - Are there good proxies for this businees?
        - Proxy are business who do something similar but not direct competitors
    - Do you want to work on this idea long time?
    - Is this a scalable business?
    - Is this a good idea space?
        - spaces can flip from hot to cold overtime

    ```
    {
        "Idea-Space": "An Idea space is one level of abstraction out from a particular startup idea. A class of closely related ideas"
    }
    ```

## What makes a good idea seem bad 
Ideas that
- are Hard to get started
- are in a Boring space
- have existing competitors

## How to come up with new ideas 
- The best way to have startup ideas is to notice them "Organically" but who says we can't come up with them.
- Become on expert on something valuable. 
- work at a startup
- Build something you find interesting
- #1: start with what your team is good at
- #2: start with a problem you have encountered personally

```
{
    - Think of every gig, job and stuffs i've done
    - what problems or ooppourtunites exist there?
}
```
- #3: THink of things you personally wished existed
- #4: Look for things in the world that have changed recently
- #5: Look for new variant of successful companies
- #6: Talk to people. Ask about the problems the have.
---AtoB case study
- The founders picked an idea space: the trucking industries
- They made themselves expert in the space by driving to truck stops and talking to truck drivers
- Spoke to other founders in the space
- Evaluated several ideas before settling with FUEL CARD.
- Look for big industries that seem broken
- Find a cofounder with an idea

There is no way to tell if an idea is Good or not, you just got to LAUNCH IT AND FIND OUT.
